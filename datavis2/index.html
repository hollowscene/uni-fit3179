            <div class="leftcolumn">
                Overall trend of climate change over time: Increasing exponentially.
                Aside from Europe, every continent is experiencing an <span style="color: royalblue"> exponential increase in carbon emissions</span>.

                Despite recent actions of the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, carbon emissions are still growing out of control.
            </div>
            <div class="rightcolumn">
                Use the dropdown to filter by the general trend of carbon emissions per capita per continent (try to make this a hover instead).
                Why is Europe the only one showing a non-increasing trend? Several factors... e.g. actual impactful and practical policy around fighting climate change.

            <div class="leftcolumn">
                On a global scale there is still a clear disparity between the carbon emissions produced by different countries.
                This map shows the per capita CO2 emissions produced by every country. Use the slider to adjust the year being shown.

        <h1 class="heading">Inequality And Negligence: Whose Problem Is It?</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
            Whose fight is it? There's no simple answer but its clear that more needs to be done, especially by more wealthy countries.
            </div>

            <div class="rightcolumn">
            The richest countries, who have the most avenue to fix climate change, and are least likely to be impacted by it,
            also happen to be the ones that aren't doing enough to reduce their co2 emissions...

        <h3 class="subheading">INCOME INEQUALITY</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
            The countries most affected by climate change are often the poorest without the resources to withstand the ramifications.
            </div>

            <div class="rightcolumn">

        <h3 class="subheading">THE WORST EMITTERS</h3>
        <div id="topkchart"></div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
            CO2 emissions are largely driven by richer countries (at least per capita)

            But in fact even worse than these countries is a small subset of countries with tiny populations but massive carbon emissions such as:

            New Caledonia (30.45 Tonnes per capita)
            Qatar (37.02 Tonnes per capita)
            Mongolia (26.98 Tonnes per capita)
            Trinidad and Tobago (25.37 Tonnes per capita)
            </div>

            <div class="rightcolumn">
            These are a distinct class of countries that have tiny populations but have absolutely massive
            CO2 contributions per capita due to large mining or oil based economies and reducing the carbon emissions in these countries
            should be a priority.

            Concluding section. Firstly identify where the problem is driven the most.

            The unfortunate reality is that climate change is going to affect everyone.

            this one could be a good example for one for differentiating coal, gas, co2
            which i think is all in the dataset

            Color guide e.g. <span style="color: rosybrown">Coal</span>, <span style="color: grey">Gas</span>, <span style="color: darkred">CO2</span>
            </div>

            <div class="rightcolumn">
            We've known the science for so long. The cause is fossil fuels. But rich countries are not willing to adapt
            e.g. see this chart that shows rich countries are still producing massive amounts of fossil fuels and not slowing down

        </div>

        <div id="groupedbarchart"></div>

        <h3 class="subheading">FINAL WORDS</h3>
        The most important thing about the fight against climate change is being knowledgeable about the science around it.
        Research yourself. Share with those you know. Then potentially go out and try to help yourself by contributing to local community politics.
        Blah blah climate town stuff.
