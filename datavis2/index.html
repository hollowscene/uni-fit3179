            <div class="leftcolumn">
                Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of the current century. 
                Key findings by the United Nations have shown that human activities, 
                primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have been the main driver for climate change.
                Climate change affects everyone. 
                Rapidly rising temperatures, increased frequency of natural disasters and 
                disruption to natural fauna and flora pose dire risks for countries across the world.
            </div>
            <div class="rightcolumn">
                And yet, despite all this warning, global carbon emissions are still on the rise.
                The chart below shows that yearly carbon emissions are beginning to slow down in 
                <span style="color: #72b7b2">North America</span> and <span style="color: #e45756">Europe</span>
                but these gains are being offset by increases of carbon emissions in <span style="color: #f58518">Asia</span>
                predominantly over the last three decades.

            <h3 class="subheading">CARBON EMISSIONS PER CAPITA</h3>
            <div class="leftcolumn">
                But, looking at absolute carbon emissions doesn't tell the entire story.
                It's only natural that more populated nations need to produce more carbon emissions.
                Instead, a fairer way to analyse global carbon emissions is to look at the per capita emissions.
            </div>
            <div class="rightcolumn">
                On a global scale there is still a clear disparity between the carbon emissions produced by different countries.
                This map below shows the per capita CO2 emissions produced by every country. Use the slider to adjust the year being shown.

        <h1 class="heading">Inequality And Negligence</h1>
        <h3 class="subheading">INCOME INEQUALITY</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
                One glaring pattern from looking at per capita carbon emissions is that the countries emitting more are often
                first-world countries.
                <br />
                <br />
                If we group countries into income brackets its clear to see that poorer countries contribute substantially less carbon emissions
                to the planet than richer countries. This is a looming ethical issue as the biggest problem is that poorer countries
                will find it harder for themselves to prevent and recover from the consequences of climate change.

        <h3 class="subheading">THE WORST EMITTERS</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
                <div id="topkchart"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="rightcolumn">
                And among these rich countries is an even more glaring issue. 
                So we know that CO2 emissions are largely driven by richer countries. 
                Even worse than that, the top emitters of 2020 were a small subset 
                of countries with tiny populations but massive carbon emissions.

                    New Caledonia (30.45 Tonnes per capita)
                    Qatar (37.02 Tonnes per capita)
                    Mongolia (26.98 Tonnes per capita)
                    Trinidad and Tobago (25.37 Tonnes per capita)

                <br />
                <br />

                These are a distinct class of countries that have tiny populations but have absolutely massive
                CO2 contributions per capita due to large mining or oil based economies and reducing the carbon emissions in these countries
                should be a priority.

                Try to see if you can colour the worst emitter red and bold their name

                Normalised Stacked area chart (probably still look at inequality here so probably just do income brackets again)

                The proportion of carbon emissions from high income countries is decreasing. But its more just increasing in the upper middle class instead...

                For your interest: Try looking up your continent/region and seeing the major types of carbon emissions.

                A bit of analysis: Coal and oil are the predominant types in most of the world. 
                Some outliers: Europe has a huge dependence on gas.
                China and India are significantly more on cement because of industries.

            <div class="leftcolumn">
                The unfortunate reality is that as an individual, you really can't do that much...

                The most important thing about the fight against climate change is being knowledgeable about the science around it.
                Research yourself. Share with those you know. Then potentially go out and try to help yourself by contributing to local community politics.
                Blah blah climate town stuff.
            </div>

            <div class="rightcolumn">
                But its not all doom and gloom... 

                Recent commitments for things such as net zero by 2050 are encouraging steps forward
                And with the recent increase in devastating natural disasters
                Hopefully leaders across the world start taking action
