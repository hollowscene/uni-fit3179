            To start off with I actually want to just look at the trend of climate change over time
            Ignoring any of the countries
            So for example a super simple nonmap idiom showing the rise in CO2 since 1800 that is well annotated
    
            The storytelling behind this map is literally just going to be that clearly,
            CO2 is rising and this is a massive issue. 
            e.g. if we compare to the paris agreement recommendation: we're screwed
    
            (might want to use a different dataset for this)
    
            Then we introduce the map: 
            One of the biggest problems with solving climate change is that some countries
            are not doing enough...
    
            Here's a per capita worldwide co2 emissions.
    
            (pretty cool would actually be having the time periods for both linked but idk if thats actually possible
            like even if it was just like a line on the stacked area chart to show which year
            we are at in the world map and how much emissions we had.

        (might want to use a different dataset for this)

        Then we introduce the map: 
        One of the biggest problems with solving climate change is that some countries
        are not doing enough...

        Here's a per capita worldwide co2 emissions.

        (pretty cool would actually be having the time periods for both linked but idk if thats actually possible
        like even if it was just like a line on the stacked area chart to show which year
        we are at in the world map and how much emissions we had.

        <h3>Worldwide CO2 emissions (per capita)</h3>
        <div id="carbonmap"></div>

        Try throwing on a Dropdown for the different metrics (i.e. per capita, per GDP etc)
        Or a radio button instead of a dropdown if you want

        <br />

        Have another nonmap idiom of say the top 10 countries with highest co2 emissions per capita
        and maybe also have a rank chart for top GDP. idk which idiom type to use for that
        guess what? turns out they're all rich first world countries

        So the richest countries, who have the most avenue to fix climate change,
        also happen to be the ones that arent doing enough to reduce their co2 emissions

        yes cause and effect, the co2 is often caused because their rich and vice versa
        but yada yada yada

        <h3>The rapid rise in global carbon emissions</h3>
        <div id="temporallinechart"></div>

        https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/interactive_legend.html
        this one could be a good example for one for differentiating coal, gas, co2
        which i think is all in the dataset

        <h3>The worst emitters</h3>
        CO2 emissions are largely driven by richer countries (at least per capita)

        But in fact even worse than that is the small countries with tiny populations.
        See: New Caledonia (30.45 Tonnes per capita)
        Qatar (37.02 Tonnes per capita)
        Mongolia (26.98 Tonnes per capita)
        Trinidad and Tobago (25.37 Tonnes per capita)

        These are a special class of countries that have tiny populations but have absolutely massive
        CO2 contributions per capita due to large mining or oil based economies.

        (Have a good graphic to match with this)
