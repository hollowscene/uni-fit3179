            <div class="leftcolumn">
                Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of the current century. 
                Key findings by the United Nations have shown that human activities, 
                primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are the main driver for climate change.
                Climate change affects everyone. 
                Rapidly rising temperatures, increased frequency of natural disasters and 
                disruption to natural fauna and flora pose dire risks for the entire planet.
            </div>
            <div class="rightcolumn">
                And yet, despite all this warning, global carbon emissions are still on the rise.
                The chart below shows that yearly carbon emissions are beginning to slow down in 
                <span style="color: #72b7b2">North America</span> and <span style="color: #e45756">Europe</span>
                but these gains are being offset by increases of carbon emissions in <span style="color: #f58518">Asia</span>
                predominantly over the last three decades.

            <div class="leftcolumn">
                But, looking at absolute carbon emissions doesn't tell the entire story.
                It's only natural that more populated nations need to produce more carbon emissions.
                Instead, a fairer way to assess global carbon emissions is to look at emissions per capita.
            </div>
            <div class="rightcolumn">
                On a global scale there is a clear disparity between the carbon emissions produced by different countries.
                The map below shows the per capita CO2 emissions produced by every country. Use the slider to adjust the year being shown.

                <h3 class="subheading">INCOME INEQUALITY</h3>
                One glaring pattern from looking at per capita carbon emissions is that the countries emitting more are often
                first-world countries.
                <br />
                <br />
                The chart on the right shows the mean carbon emissions per capita for countries
                grouped by income in 2020. Poorer countries contribute 
                substantially less carbon emissions to the planet than richer countries. This is a looming problem 
                as these poorer countries lack the financial resources to prevent and recover from 
                the consequences of climate change.

                <h3 class="subheading">THE WORST EMITTERS</h3>
                While CO2 emissions are largely driven by richer countries, its not always the case. 
                The chart on the left shows the top 10 worst emitting countries in any particular year. 
                In recent decades, the worst emitters are often lower-middle or upper-middle income countries
                who rely on carbon intensive industries such as <span style="color: #74c476">coal</span> mining.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is a huge political issue. These countries have economies that are overly reliant on these 
                carbon intensive industries which means they are often unable to reduce emissions without
                significant impacts to their economies. But on the other hand it sets a bad example for 
                even poorer nations who may question why these other countries get a free pass.

            <div class="leftcolumn">
                <h3 class="subheading">THE GROWING MIDDLE CLASS</h3>
                While the proportion of carbon emissions from high-income countries is decreasing, its mostly driven by a 
                sharp rise in carbon emissions emitted by middle-income countries. This is especially the 
                case for <span style="color: #5254a3">cement</span> and <span style="color: #74c476">coal</span> which are largely driven by rapidly developing countries like <span style="color: #f58518">India</span> and <span style="color: #f58518">China</span>.
                <br />
                <br />
                This will be an important consideration for policy makers. As the lives of people
                in more and more countries improves, so to will the carbon emissions they emit increase.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
                Climate change is an incredibly complex issue. The chart below lets you explore 
                which carbon types are emitted the most by region. Some interesting cases such as Europe's huge reliance
                on <span style="color: #e7ba52">gas</span> and India and China's huge reliance on <span style="color: #5254a3">cement</span> show that theres no one simple solution.
            </div>
            <div class="rightcolumn">
                There is a wide diversity of fossil fuel usage and dependence across the world
                and different countries will find it more difficult to cut some fossil fuels than others.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="leftcolumn">
                The unfortunate reality is that as an individual, you really can't do that much to stop climate change. 
                Small individual sacrifices such as taking public transport or eating less meat are beneficial,
                but will only make a small dent in the massive amounts of carbon emissions produced on a globl scale.

                <br />
                <br />

                But, its not all doom and gloom. Recent global commitments such as the Paris Agreement and Net Zero by 2050 are encouraging steps forward.
                Recent increases in the frequency of natural disasters have also placed climate change at the front
                of many peoples' minds. The fight against climate change will be a collective one and it will especially require the efforts
                of leaders of the most well-off nations.

                <br />
                <br />

                The most important thing you can do in the fight against climate change is to be informed about the science
                and to ensure that those you know are also informed. The United Nations and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
                are two global organisations that are major contributors to the fight against climate change.
